Router as server
========================

I reinstalled a firmware my NetGear wireless server. The new firmware is actually a simplified linux, where there are VPN server, FTP, media, NAS.

Finally I can have my own VPN server, meaning I can have full control of my internet access. It means a lot for a free people from China.

Next step I'm thinking is to have a kind of NAS server, or file back up system so I can fully control my files well....

I may need a server running for 7/24. How is Mac mini, which saves some power and quite :).
